    "# Problem\n",
    "We have 2 opaque bags, each containing 2 balls. One bag has 2 black balls and the other has a black and a white ball. You pick a bag at random and then pick one of the balls in that bag at random. When you look at the ball it is black. You now pick the second ball from that same bag. What is the probability that this ball is also black?"
